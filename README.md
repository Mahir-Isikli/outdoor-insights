## Contoso Sports

### Idea 

Contoso Sports developed a smart insole for skishoes, enabling advances data collection while skiing. With pressure sensors, NFC technology and in combination with the GPS service of the smartphone, the product can track many different metrics that can be used to analyze the technique and other statistics. Reports can be created after every ride and at the ned of the skiday, so that customers know, what to focus on, when it comes to the next ride. Furthermore ski equipment can be recommanded using ML algorithms.

### USP 

Our product can be combined with every skishoe and ski, as only the in-sole needs to be changed. Via bluetooth the product can be easily activated. Advanced reports with many different parameters are generated creating the first automated and near-real time solution for ski enthuasiast. 

### Monetarization 

Contoso Sports has different potential revenue streams in the B2C and B2B market. Inital revenues will be generated through the sale of the insole, which will usually be combined with a subscription for the mobile applications. Furthermore Contoso sports will earn commisions whenever a sale of ski equipment is initiated from our application. 

As customers select the ski they drive to gather better analytics how they ride with different skis, we are also able to sell this data to manufactures, so that they know how their ski perform, how much vibration is caused for different speeds.
